HALLUCINATIONS — Watson (fiction)

This website is a **fictional / satirical** “hallucination report generator”.

How it works (static; no AI model runs here)
- Blue input: invented “Watson facts” (intentionally absurd).
- Red input: copied excerpts from external websites (NASA, National Geographic, IKEA, AHO, ArchDaily, BBC Food).
- Output: confident nonsense reports showing how mixing sources can create “hallucinations”.

Important
- Do not treat the reports as factual biography.
- The title of each report always includes the name “Watson”.
